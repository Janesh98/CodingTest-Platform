## Overview
The main goal of this project was to build a coding test platform for companies to use as a means to assess potential new hires. We built a live coding environment allowing candidates to complete a coding test along with the option to complete video responses to questions proposed by an employer. In addition to this employers will have access to a results section where participants code solution and  analytics about candidateâ€™s submissions are give(i.e.  CPU time and memory used). This application was built using the MERN stack along with docker and is hosted on Firebase and google cloud.
