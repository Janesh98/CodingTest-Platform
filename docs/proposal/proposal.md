### Introduction

> This project will be a full stack web application covering frontend and backend technologies.

### Outline

> The main goal of the project is to build a coding test platform for businesses to use as a means to assess potential new hires. We will build a live coding environment allowing candidates to complete a coding test along with the option to complete video responses to questions proposed by an employer. In addition to this employers will have access to an analytics section where candidates are ranked based on performance.

### Background

> Our idea came from looking at Stephen Blotts projects, specifically the einstein project. We decided to build a variation on this project and we thought of coding tests as we were already discussing how we did in coding tests for companies we applied to.

### Achievements

> There will be two main users for this coding test plaform.
> 1. Employers will use this web application to access applicants for jobs. Employers will be able to use the application for several functions:
>     * Set coding challenges for the applicants, the employer will provide a description of the challenge as well as the test cases for each challenge to test the applicants code when it is run.
>     *  The employer will also have the option to set questions for each applicant to record a video response
    
### Justification

> 1. why? - It allows business to assess an applicants coding skills.
> 2. when? - It is online so coding tests can be performed at any time.
> 3. where? - It is online so coding tests can be performed anywhere.
> 4. how? - By providing a coding test platform, video responses and analytics it allows an employer to effectively assess an applicants ability and rank the best candidates.

### Programming language(s)

> JavaScript

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> This project will be build with MERN stack. MERN stands for the four technologies that make up the stack:
> 1. MongoDB
>     * A NoSQL, document based database. JSON documents created in the front end can be sent to the Express.js server, where they can be processed and stored directly in MongoDB for later retrieval. 
> 2. Express.js
>     *  Server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server, Express.js contains models for URL routing and handling HTTP requests and responses.
> 3. React.js
>     * The front-end, it's a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> 4. Node.js
>     * The back-end, Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows you use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

### Hardware

> N/A.

### Learning Challenges

> 1. MongoDB
> 2. Express.js
> 3. React.js
> 4. Node.js
> 5. javaScript
> 6. Jest
> 7. CI/CD.

### Breakdown of work

> Clearly identify who will undertake which parts of the project.
>
> It must be clear from the explanation of this breakdown of work both that each student is responsible for
> separate, clearly-defined tasks, and that those responsibilities substantially cover all of the work required
> for the project.
