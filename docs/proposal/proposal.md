## SECTION B


### Introduction

> This project will be a full stack web application covering frontend and backend technologies with CI/CD.

### Outline

> The main goal of the project is to build a coding test platform for companies to use as a means to assess potential new hires. We will build a live coding environment allowing candidates to complete a coding test along with the option to complete video responses to questions proposed by an employer. In addition to this employers will have access to an analytics section where candidates are ranked based on performance.

### Background

> Our idea came from looking at Stephen Blott's project ideas, specifically the einstein project. We decided to build a variation on this project and we thought of coding tests as we were already discussing how we did in coding tests for companies we applied to.

### Achievements

> There will be two main users for this coding test platform.
> 1. Employers will use this web application to access applicants for jobs. Employers will be able to use the application for several functions:
>     * Set coding challenges for the applicants, the employer will provide a description of the challenge as well as the test cases for each challenge to test the applicants code when it is run.
>     *  The employer will also have the option to set questions for each applicant to record a video response.
>     * After the applicant(s) have completed the application process, the employer will be able to view the analytics from the applicant(s) i.e. time to complete coding challenges.
> 2. Applications will use this web application to complete the coding challenges and provide video responses set by the employer.
>     * Applicants will be able to choose from a selection which programming  language they would like to use for the coding challenges.
>     * They will be able to run their code against the test cases before submitting their final code.
    
### Justification

> 1. why? - It allows business to assess an applicants coding skills.
> 2. when? - It is online so coding tests can be performed at any time.
> 3. where? - It is online so coding tests can be performed anywhere.
> 4. how? - By providing a coding test platform, video responses and analytics it allows an employer to effectively assess an applicants ability and rank the best candidates.

### Programming language(s)

> JavaScript

### Programming tools / Tech stack

> This project will be build with MERN stack. MERN stands for the four technologies that make up the stack:
> 1. MongoDB
>     * A NoSQL, document based database. JSON documents created in the front end can be sent to the Express.js server, where they can be processed and stored directly in MongoDB for later retrieval. 
> 2. Express.js
>     *  Server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server, Express.js contains models for URL routing and handling HTTP requests and responses.
> 3. React.js
>     * The front-end, it's a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> 4. Node.js
>     * The back-end, Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows you use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.
